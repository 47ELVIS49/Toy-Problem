# Week 1 Toy Problems
This is an outline to the Solution for my Speed Detector
## Repository Structure

- **solution.js**: Solution for the Speed Detector challenge.

## Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Repository**: Create a repository on your GitHub account to store the solutions.

2. **JavaScript**: The solutions are implemented in JavaScript.

3. **File Organization**: Each solution should be in a separate file within the repository.


## Challenge 2: Speed Detector

Write a program that takes the speed of a car as input (e.g., 80). If the speed is less than 70, it should print "Ok". Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

> For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: "Points: 2". If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: "License suspended".

### Running the Solution

To run the solution, execute the corresponding JavaScript file using a JavaScript runtime environment. If you are using Node.js, use the following command:

Example:
```bash
node SOLUTION.JS
